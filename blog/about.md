I'm a web developer. My current focus is Ruby on Rails.

I started my career in the enterprise software world. After playing support and consultant roles and interfacing with customers in a variety of settings, I decided that I'm tired of "enterprise" and started to look for something more exciting. I dabbled in front-end programming for a while, and eventually taught myself Ruby on Rails. I have been in love with it ever since, to the point where I decided to pursue it as a full-time career.

What I enjoy the most about programming is that it helps me experience the child-like wonder of creating new things to solve problems. Few things give me as much satisfaction as being in the "zone" while thinking about a difficult problem. Past experience has shown me that I do my best work in that type of work environment.

I would describe myself as passionate and curious. Whatever it is that I do, I want to take pride in my work. To me, merely solving a problem is not enough; to sleep well, I also need to solve it efficiently and elegantly. Like most techies, I'm opinionated, but not to the point where it gets in the way of working with others. Indeed, I love working in team environments and learning from my peers.

If you are working on interesting problems and are looking for a Rails developer, I'd love to hear from you.
